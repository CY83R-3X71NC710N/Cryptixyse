# Cryptixyse

## Introduction
Cryptixyse is a project designed to create an encryption and decryption system using Python that utilizes elliptic curve encryption for increased security. Utilizing libraries such as Crypto and PyCryptodome, this project seeks to generate the keys and encrypt and decrypt the data for the highest security. SHA-256 is also used for further hashing. This project is a prototype and is intended to be built upon to make it into what it was designed to become.

## What is Cryptixyse?
Cryptixyse is a project created to create an encryption and decryption system that utilizes elliptic curve encryption for increased security. The project utilizes libraries such as Crypto and PyCryptodome to generate the keys and encrypt and decrypt the data for the highest security. SHA-256 is also used for further hashing. The project is a prototype and is intended to be built upon to make it into what it was designed to become.

The name Cryptixyse is derived from the words "cryptography" and "analytics". Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties and Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. Combining these two words is a powerful way to describe the project's purpose and goals.

## Goals
- Create a secure encryption and decryption system using Python.
- Utilize elliptic curve encryption for increased security.
- Utilize libraries such as Crypto and PyCryptodome to generate the keys and encrypt and decrypt the data.
